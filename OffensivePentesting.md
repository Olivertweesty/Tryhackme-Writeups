## Task one - Deploy the machine 
No answer needed

## Task two - Reconnaissance
The task requires student to use nmap to gather infomation on the target machine. 
1. There are many nmap "cheatsheets" online that you can use too
    cheatsheet: https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/
2. Scan the box, how many ports are open?
    use the nmap command to scan all ports
    nmap -p- <insert machine ip> (Takes longer to scan the host) 
    nmap -Pn <insert machine ip> (Faster BUT disables host dicovery)-lists open ports
    answer: 6 
3. What version of the squid proxy is running on the machine?
    use the nmap command to scan services running on the target
    nmap -sV <insert machine ip> 
    answer: 3.5.12 (subject to change)
4. How many ports will nmap scan if the flag -p-400 was used?
    The flag is used to specify the number of ports that will be scanned
    answer: 400 
5. Using the nmap flag -n what will it not resolve?
    The flag -n implies that nmap will never perform DNS resolution 
    answer: DNS
6. What is the most likely operating system this machine is running?
    The nmap flag for OS discovery is -A among others 
    nmap -A <insert machine ip> 
    answer: ubuntu (subject to change) 
7. What port is the web server running on?
    According to results acquired in 2 above, the web server runs on port 3333. 
    nmap -Pn <insert machine ip> 
    answer: 3333 (subject to change) 
8. Its important to ensure you are always doing your reconnaissance thoroughly before progressing. Knowing all open services (which can all be points of exploitation) is very important, don't forget that ports on a higher range might be open so always scan ports after 1000 (even if you leave scanning in the background)
    answer: completed
